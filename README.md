#Summary: 

An AI assistant trained on Northwood curricula that prioritizes students’ mastery and comprehension. It will be trained on Northwood teacher approved material with an eye-catching front end for students to access. 

#Background: 

I am passionate about computer science, and I have a history in peer tutoring. I believe that everyone can learn complex topics if they have the right teacher. This is very challenging though; every teacher has their own teaching style, and every student has their own learning style. 

#Goals: 

The main goal is to create an AI-powered tutor chatbot. Along the way, I want to build connections with people in artificial intelligence and computer science. I want to learn more about the process of teaching so that I can teach others more effectively. I want to get better at back end and front-end coding. 

#Essential Questions: 

Why do students struggle with learning? How can they learn more easily? Is AI able to help students learn and achieve their academic goals? What makes a good teacher a good teacher? How can I be a better teacher? 

#Activities & Sources: 

Speak with Northwood teachers to collect quality data. Design an architecture for the project. Reach out to and make connections with people who work with AI for a living. Learn more about the process and evolve my original product. Once the product is built up and up to standard, give Northwood students access. Gather information from students to improve their experience. 

#Learning Product: 

I will create a public tool for Northwood students to use. It is a complex process to design and build a website that utilizes artificial intelligence. 

#Presentation & Publishing Plan: 

Create and publicize a website for Northwood students to use. Share it through social media and word of mouth.
